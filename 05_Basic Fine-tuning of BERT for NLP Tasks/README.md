BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful pre-trained language model that has revolutionized natural language processing tasks. It is based on the Transformer architecture and is trained on a massive corpus of text data in an unsupervised manner, learning rich contextual representations of language.
